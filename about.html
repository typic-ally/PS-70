### About Me

Hello, my name is Allison Fairman. I'm from Honolulu, and I am homeschooled. I plan to major in architecture one day, which is why I registered for this course, as architecture requires some digital programming and engineering, depending on the career I choose. This course caught my interest because it incorporates both physics and engineering skills, something I intend to learn more abouut. I also need the credits this course offers, because the school I attend does not offer any physics courses. 


My interests include gaming, digital design, and anything related to skincare. I recognized my passion in art at the age of 7, when I would create handmade crafts using polymer clay, and I even made little accessories for my dolls. By the age of ten, I became dependent in gaming and made digital architectural designs on gaming platforms like Roblox, Minecrafts, and Sims 4.

This design was made completely from scratch, except for the backyard.

This backyard/fountain area was inspired by a Museum in paris called "Mus√©e Carnavalet"

This build was also made from scratch, It was inspired by a dream I had of this exact house overlooking the ocean. I didn't know what the entire floorplan looked like, but I knew the house was blue, what the porch looked like, and the oceanview I had. I ended up drawing the rest out, and eventually made this in Sims 4 (My own sim even lives in it). **P.S, the landscaping counts too and was also made completely from scratch.**


The restaurant was basically a renovation of something I found in the sims 4 gallery that was already built. I customized all of it, the only thing remaining would be part of the interior floorplan and a bit of the exterior's structure as well.
Here is the restaurant **before** and **after** (Completed):
