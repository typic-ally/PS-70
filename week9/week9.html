#### Week 9 - Radio, WiFi, Bluetooth (IoT)
By: Allison Fairman

I chose to collaborate with a student on my Radio, WiFi, and Bluetooth project. We began with launching the Arduino code provided during lab. Then, we generated and exchanged our MAC addresses, and entered them into the "broadcastAddress" portion of the code.

Our main intention was to monitor each other's SerialPrint statuses remotely. If the reading went well, it would say "Delivery success." Otherwise, it would say "Delivery Fail."

It took a few failed attempts to perform a successful reading, but it worked. The primary issue that prevented the reading was the broadcast address, as I had placed a number incorrectly for my partner's MAC address.

Here is the finishing product!
