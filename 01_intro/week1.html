#### Week 1: Introduction 

The initial plan for the project was to create something related to architecture or anything in which I am passionate about. I want this to be a passion project, but since the project requires to be programmable in some form, it might take me a while to come up with a solid plan.


The second idea I had in mind was to develop a Bluetooth or wireless selfie stick. A gadget that can trigger the camera sensor without requiring a cable or gripping stick that can take images from a distance using a remote. This would make the process of taking pictures easier and faster, especially self-portraits and family photographs. I know that there are certain devices that are similar and have already been established, but I believe this would be an interesting and reasonable project to explore.

My third idea is to design an automated device that can detec moisture in a plant's soil and assist the planter by identifying the amount of water that is needed for the plant's soil, then dispensing the amount that is needed. This would require me to use a soil moisture sensor, and some kind of programmable device that can control the waterflow of the dispenser.

As I mentioned before, I am an arts and crafts lover, especially throughout my childhood. One of my favorite things to make as a child was slime, and it was very simple to make. However, this was always a very messy process, so I thought of a fun and useful concept that can benefit children that also enjoy to make slime: a slime machine. Slime is activated when the polyvinyl alcohol in glue and a detergent containing borate ions are combined. This would be a machine that can distribute those substances into a container and handle all of the messy contractions that slime entails: the mixing and distributing process (Glue, borax/detergent, and lotion (to soften the substance). This machine would not be completely hands-free, since there is a kneading process that requires some arm strength and, of course, human hands. Thankfully, the machine should make the overall process less messy, as the stirring and pouring is considered to be the messiest part. The hotdog machine was my inspiration for this concept. The tubes that distributed the condiments on the hotdog caught my interest, and I found it very useful for a mess-free project in the future.

My last idea is still in process, but I was thinking it should be associated with gaming. If it's associated with gaming, it's most likely going to be programmable!
