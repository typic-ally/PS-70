#### Week 2 - 2D Design & Cutting
By: Allison Fairman

I tried to to construct a laser cutting piece for this week's project using both Fusion 360 and Blender. While I am familiar with blender, I have never used it to make sketches. I had planned to build a house, but because it was difficult to figure out the required measurements for the roof, so I chose to create a puzzle piece instead.

For this puzzle piece, I sketched the sides out using the SOLID line tool. (Here's the base of the puzzle piece before adding the dimensions).

Then I changed the dimensions to 100.00-120.00 (using the dimensions tool), and made the cut dimensions the same size as the thickness of the cardboard I used to cut it in.

Lastly, I saved the project as a DXF by right-clicking the "sketches" menu under "Browser," then transferred the DXF file to the flash drive.

I used a different platform for the 3D design, since Fusion 360 was just too difficult to work with and didn't click for me as a beginner. I'm sure I could spend more time figuring out the platform later, but since this third assignment was time-sensitive, I went with something I could work with.

I started off the ice cream cone with the base, which is the cone. I went to the 3D shapes menu and selected the "cone" option, then I rotated it vertically by 40 degrees.

Next I used the Sphere and Hemisphere to make an ice cream scoop structure. I ended up stacking the Sphere by copying and pasting it and scaling portions of it down to give it a collapsing look.

Lastly, I colored each shape and added the whip cream using the 3D "doodle" tool, followed up with the cherry piece by using another sphere and curved cylinder.

Here is the finishing product!

I also learned how to extrude a sketch, so I used the sunflower sketch from a prior kinetic sculpture and layered them on top of each other to give it more of a blossoming aspect. I layered the kinetic sculpture piece exactly like this picture for week 3.
